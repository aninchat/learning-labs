This lab deploys an ERB-based EVPN VXLAN fabric with symmetric routing for unicast traffic, using Juniper vJunos-switch nodes as leafs and spines of a 3-stage Clos fabric and a centrally routed design for multicast traffic. You can deploy the fabric using `containerlab deploy -t inter-vlan-multicast-crb.clab.yaml`. The receivers can be made to join a specific group (considering 239.1.1.1 as an example group here) by using `sudo ip addr add 239.1.1.1/32 dev eth1 autojoin` and then a group leave can be generated by `sudo ip addr del 239.1.1.1/32 dev eth1`. Make sure you replace `eth1` with whatever interface you are using. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minimum Containerlab version for the deployment of this lab is v0.62. A bare metal server is needed for vJunos-switch nodes. Running Containerlab in a VM will not work.  

>Ostinato containers are multicast sources in this fabric. This is a paid resource - if you do not have this, you can use Linux containers with iperf to generate multicast traffic; however, having said, that I highly recommend just buying an Ostinato container license.  

The topology is shown below. The username/password for vJunos-switch nodes is `admin/admin@123` and the username/password for the servers is `user/multit00l`.
